# Introduction

Most Web Designers are torn between the choice of using a fluid, fixed,hybrid or elastic design. As the second day of the new year rolls in and as part of my new year resolutions, I have promised to create a mock-up using each tech that I'm conversant with and make it available on my GitHub page. Last year was a very busy one and although I'm still on vacation travelling till on Friday (the first Friday in 2017), I'll try to code whenever I get time and push to GitHub that way I'm sure people will have seen my uncomplete code and thus motivate myself to finish it.

I have used my fathers farm in Kenya as an example or inspiration in making this website. Apart from been a medical doctor, my fathers passion was in farming. He did that on the side as an hobby which turned out to be a business and a very prolific one for that matter. He was sought after by brokers who would buy his farm produce (fruits) for less and later sell them for profit. It was difficult for him to venture and create a rapport with clients overseas because internet connectivity was still evolving in that part of the world, but times have changed now. 

Farmers now have a clear idea of how much their raw materials (fruits, coffee, tea, cocoa, etc) fetch not only locally, but in the international markets. They can fathom how to add value in their products and the cons and pros of selling raw materials as opposed to selling processed products. [This]() for instance will cost more than [this]() because there is value added in it. 

When I was studying [Entrepreneurship](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/WTLNATFS2JEL)  at [Mtech](http://eip.umd.edu/) , one of my professors at that time Prof. [James Green](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jvgreen) stressed so much about the Customer Development Process (CDP). He said that during CDP, you must have a functional way to search for your customers and in retrospect, I have validated all his lectures in real life situations. There is a reason as to why many companies today are opting to use [Social Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media) to direct potentials customers to their websites in order to close sales. 

Statistical estimates show that the number of worldwide social media users reached [1.96 billion](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273476/percentage-of-us-population-with-a-social-network-profile/) in 2016 and is expected to grow to some **2.5 billion** by 2018. In a nutshell, I would say that any company which is willing to scale should venture into tech because as it gets inculcated and interwoven in our lives, you get to reach more customers and you get to know WHO they really are, which takes me the next point which is [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics) (GA) and [Adwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdWords). 

GA is the most powerful web analytics tool on the planet as of the time of writing this. It's free, very user friendly, easy to set-up, no coding required, it's from a reputable company (**Google**) and above all it's evolving with the current tech and market trends. (*Current Version is* (**Google Analytics 5**))

I consider this simple website as GA ready because it's SEO optimised. 
I wont go into depth about GA, but below are some reasons as to why you may consider to use it:

1. Get info on who uses *Mobile Device* for your website and thus create a *Responsive Design*.
1. Know who visits and doesn't close a sale in an *E-store*.
1. In a *Multi pages* website, you can identify which pages ARE, are NOT or are RARELY visited.
1. Know demographics of your visitors.
1. Know your trending products or pages.
1. Know which marketing strategy is efficient eg on FB, Twitter, etc.
1. Get detailed analytics data from your online businesses .

## Adwords and SEO 

I wont go in depth about Adwords and SEO but in a nutshell, it does provide you with a lot of information regarding your website visitors. Whenever I'm designing a website, I make sure that it's [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) ready. That means that the google Crawler or Bot does rank your website in the google search engine; you can benefit more if your website is linked to a google analytics account. 

There are a lot of things that can put your business in a competitive edge is you use google analytics. Here are a few of them. 


If I were to search for *Sennheiser headphones* under [google images](https://images.google.com/), then if my business is into headphones, I would make sure my image is of a high resolution, is responsive and it indeed does show on the first page of the [google search results](https://www.google.it/search?q=Sennheiser+headphones&client=firefox-b-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIv5ulpqPRAhUDO1AKHUshBPgQ_AUICCgB&biw=1147&bih=1278). [This](https://www.google.it/search?q=Sennheiser+headphones&client=firefox-b-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIv5ulpqPRAhUDO1AKHUshBPgQ_AUICCgB&biw=1147&bih=1278#imgrc=MD00_ynlFNI49M%3A) for instance can increase conversion rates much faster than [this](https://www.google.it/search?q=Sennheiser+headphones&client=firefox-b-ab&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIv5ulpqPRAhUDO1AKHUshBPgQ_AUICCgB&biw=1147&bih=1278#imgrc=GnkHxTBJ0c39OM%3A).

As an example, [the appwebtech](http://theappwebtech.com/) is a website that has no data on the [FrontEnd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) at this moment but has a fully functional [BackEnd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) system with data within it's servers which can be accessed by whomever has encrypted links to it. Let's take a view of last month's activity . 

It's easy to know the demographics of my visitors, even though in my case, I already knew them before hand as I handed them the links to fetch whatever data they wanted, but in an online store for instance, this information would be vital.

An overview of your audience and type of tech they are using in regard to browsers, OS, age, service providers, platforms like mobile or desktop can help create decisions on how to market your products.

### Browsers
[Image, Analytics 3]()

### Platforms (Mobile or Desktop)
[Image, Analytics 4]()

### Mobile (Devices)
I can dig deeper to find out how many sessions were logged using an iPhone for instance. 
[Image, Analytics 5]()

### Cohort Analysis 
In BETA now is a Cohort Analysis that creates acquisition data cohorts by User Interaction both in data percentages and graphs.
[Image, Analytics 6]()

There are many ways that Google Analytics can create a competitive advantage to your products but the most important aspect in the design process is a website which is SEO ready. 


## Deployment instructions

This website can be viewed [here](#) and can be deployed to any webserver via FTP. Been a single page Fluid Design, with no database in the BackEnd, it's maintenance costs are close to zero and it's relevance is purely for marketing purposes.
